# loanCalculator

The project is hosted under http://51.91.8.173:8762/index.html, therefore there was no release package

Some of the constants should be moved out to configuration (i.e. API urls, fixed loan rates)
Some of features are blocked(there was no need to implement them - i.e. different loan types - they have disabled fields)
